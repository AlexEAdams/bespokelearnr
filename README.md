# bespokelearnr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package generates bespoke learning materials for a workshop-style
class that provides an introduction to the emerging field of Data
Science in R, including data analysis and visualization, with a
particular focus on its utility for biological insight. In class,
students will be provided with biological datasets using this package,
and introduced to the `tidyverse` and `code` used to examine data.

## Installation

You **cannot** yet install the released version of tidybiology from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("bespokelearnr")
```

So in the meantime, use the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matthewhirschey/bespokelearnr")
```
